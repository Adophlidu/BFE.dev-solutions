* The aspect-ratio CSS property sets a preferred aspect ratio for the box, which will be used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions.
* The Height is calculated automatically depends on width when using aspect-ratio.
* The golden ratio is 1.618.
* Set the aspect-ratio property to golden ratio (1.618).

```
.golden-ratio {
  background-color: #ccc;
  aspect-ratio: 1.618;
}
```
