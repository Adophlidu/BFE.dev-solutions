You can use both, but it's preferable to use `null`.

`undefined` is mainly used by the JS engine for props that have been declared but haven't assigned value.

`null` - it's a more specific type that developers use as a value, and usually, it's described as an empty result.

See references: [null](https://javascript.info/types#the-null-value), [undefined](https://javascript.info/types#the-undefined-value)
